                                            I am in that frustrating stage of my desk signalling project where I have achieved a large amount of what I set out to do, but I now need to bring all of the problems I solved together and organise it (both in my head and in some form of documentation for future me). Suddenly, though, every single programming book; cloud concept and component on PiHut looks exceptionally appealing to me (my attention).

                                            I am using this post to test the GitHub actions automation; my concern is that it will end up in an infinite loop, but really I only want the pipeline to run when I am the user creating the commit... Let's see...

                                            With lots going on in life at the moment, I have been put off updating my blog because of how cumbersome I found the process of updating my - otherwise flawlessly designed - blog. So, last night I set about writing something that is totally OTT to solve this problem for me. Instead of moving things about (maybe 3 minutes of effort), I wrote a Python script to run whenever I commit to my blog repo, it renders my new post into the existing page and moves my old post into the old-post-archive-stack thing below. I want to refine it a bit more, but it does what I need right now. So I can keep firing off thoughts into the Ether.

                                            There is nothing inherently interesting about this statement, but it is fascinating
                                            to watch the UK fall to its sweaty knees come Summer, or even Spring. I am not immune
                                            to the drop, having spent the second (or third?) heatwave of 2025 indoors with the curtains
                                            drawn, but I do think, with the planet suffering the effects of global industrialisation, that 
                                            it's time we start considering more than just insulation for our wall cavities, and thinking
                                            about some less ephemeral [read: tower fan] home-improvements for the summer months.

                                                I've been toying with the idea of having a space to just send thoughts; to create strings of words; 
                                                to vaguely document things that I think are interesting. I stumbled across the 98.css project a while 
                                                ago and have been playing with it ever since. I have thrown this together with the idea that I might
                                                - at some point - optimise the blog. But, for now, I am happy.
