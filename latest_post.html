                                            I am in that frustrating stage of my desk signalling project where I have achieved a large amount of what I set out to do, but I now need to bring all of the problems I solved together and organise it (both in my head and in some form of documentation for future me). Suddenly, though, every single programming book; cloud concept and component on PiHut looks exceptionally appealing to me (my attention).
