                                            With lots going on in life at the moment, I have been put off updating my blog because of how cumbersome I found the process of updating my - otherwise flawlessly designed - blog. So, last night I set about writing something that is totally OTT to solve this problem for me. Instead of moving things about (maybe 3 minutes of effort), I wrote a Python script to run whenever I commit to my blog repo, it renders my new post into the existing page and moves my old post into the old-post-archive-stack thing below. I want to refine it a bit more, but it does what I need right now. So I can keep firing off thoughts into the Ether.
